Exercise-induced nausea is a feeling of sickness or vomiting which can occur shortly after exercise has stopped as well as during exercise itself.

It may be a symptom of either over-exertion during exercise, or from too abruptly ending an exercise session. People engaged in high-intensity exercise such as aerobics and bicycling have reported suffering from exercise-induced nausea


Post-Pilates nausea is uncommon, but not unheard of. While no peer-reviewed studies address the Pilates and nausea problem directly, research regarding nausea after other types of exercise offers insight into this issue. Numerous conditions, such as room temperature, and high or low blood pressure, may cause nausea after a Pilates class.
