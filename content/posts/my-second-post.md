*‘As soon as it works, no one calls it AI any more’*
	*- John McCarthy, one of the pioneers of AI*
	
	
	
	
Since its beginning, artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny from scientists and the public alike. One common theme is the idea that machines will become so highly developed that humans will not be able to keep up, and they will take off on their own, redesigning themselves at an exponential rate.

While it is important to address legitimate concerns about AI, extreme fears of AI taking over the world or destroying humankind seem more a reflection of human fears of the unknown and tribal fears of the “other” than a reality of AI research. If left unaddressed, these irrational fears may become a hindrance to AI research and prevent us from enjoying the enormous potential benefits that robots co-working with humans could bring.
