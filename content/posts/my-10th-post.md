* **Descriptive statistics** (*describe the basic features of the data in the study. Provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures*)

	* **count** (*a total number of values*)

	* **unique** (*the only one value of its kind*)

	* **top** (*the top value in a categorical data set*)
	
	* **frequency** (*the number of times a value appears in the set*)
	
	* **mean** (*the average of the numerical values*)
	
	* **standard deviation** (*the amount of variation of a set of data values*)
	
	* **minimum** (*the smallest numerical value*)
	
	* **maximum** (*the largest numerical value*)
	
	* **25/50/75 percentile** (*the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the numerical data*)

* **Numerical analysis** (*analysis of data which only contains numbers*)

	* **histogram** (*a diagram where axis X represents the data divided into adjacent intervals and axis Y represents how frequently that data appears in the set*)

* **Categorical data analysis** (*non-numerical data analysis*)

	* **bar chart** (*a diagram where axis X represents a value of a chosen column in a data set and axis Y repesents its corresponding numerical value*)
